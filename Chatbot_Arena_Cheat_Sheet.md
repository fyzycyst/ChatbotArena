# Chatbot Arena Cheat Sheet

## Overview
A multi-agent debate system (e.g., Grok vs. Gemini) excels in iterative refinement, error correction, and diverse perspectives, often yielding better results than single models. Focus on turn limits for API efficiency; develop with lite/flash models before premium.

## Classes of Use Cases
Where debates outperform individual chatbots:

- **Complex Problem Solving & Reasoning**: Multi-step puzzles, debugging (e.g., code errors). Agents propose/critique for robust, error-free solutions.
- **Creative Brainstorming**: Idea generation (e.g., stories, campaigns). Builds on suggestions, explores wider spaces for originality.
- **Ethical/Philosophical Dilemmas**: Ambiguous topics (e.g., AI in justice). Balances pros/cons, reduces bias for nuanced answers.
- **Evaluation Tasks**: Content review (e.g., essays, code). Discusses criteria for accurate, human-like assessments.
- **Scientific/Strategic Planning**: Hypothesizing, synthesizing research (e.g., business strategies). Integrates insights for comprehensive plans.

**Tips**: Use roles (proposer/critic), turn limits; draws from multi-agent frameworks for self-correction.

## Early-Stage Advice (Lite/Flash Models)
Iterate prompts/structure cost-effectively before premium models:

### Prompt Engineering
- Start simple: Define roles, rules (e.g., 200-word limit, end with summary).
- A/B test variations; add chain-of-thought for deeper reasoning.
- Encourage convergence (e.g., "Propose consensus in final turn").

### Testing Workflows
- Curate 5-10 test cases from use cases; reuse for tracking.
- Simulate offline with open-source models; batch API runs.
- Compare to single-model baselines; log metrics (accuracy, coherence).

### Debate Structure
- Test turns (3-5), formats (alternating critique/proposal).
- Fixed roles for balance; add early termination logic.
- Token limits in prompts (e.g., <300) for efficiency.

### Evaluation & Best Practices
- Score manually/automated (1-5 scale); use models for self-eval.
- Error handling/retry in code; gradual scaling to premium.
- Draw from papers/forums for templates; aim for 50-70% cost reduction.

**Pro Tip**: Treat as "prompt lab" â€“ refine to de-risk final runs. Share specifics for tailored advice!
