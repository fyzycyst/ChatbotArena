## Gemini CLI Notes
- Use Gemini CLI to generate component scaffolds, outline routing structures, and draft lightweight ADRs before implementation.
- Provide runnable Next.js or npm scripts when suggesting changes (e.g., `npm run dev`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`); note required env vars or API mocks.
- Call out visual or UX assumptions so later design reviews know what to validate in the browser.
