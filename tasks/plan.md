# Chatbot Arena Expansion Agile Plan

## Overview
This plan organizes the expansion roadmap into a series of four-week release cycles composed of two-week sprints. Each sprint contains user stories mapped to backlog epics derived from the expansion vision. Stories are accompanied by acceptance criteria and implementation tasks. Cross-cutting enablers and risk mitigation activities are also identified.

## Cross-Cutting Activities
- **UX Research & Design**: Conduct user interviews at start of each release cycle; maintain design system components in `/frontend`.
- **Documentation**: Update developer docs and user guides every sprint; maintain architecture decision records in `/docs/adr`.
- **Security & Compliance**: Run dependency audits each sprint; threat modeling session before Release Cycle 4.
- **Observability**: Instrument backend with logging/metrics; add tracing for orchestrator workflows by Sprint 6.

## Risk Mitigation & Dependencies
- Validate technology stack choice (Node vs. Python) during Sprint 1 with proof-of-concept spike.
- Establish contract tests between frontend and backend to catch schema drift.
- Create fallback strategies for local LLM availability (mock provider) before enabling team orchestration.
- Engage infra team early for storage solutions if assets exceed local capacity.

## Definition of Done per Story
1. Code merged with tests passing and documentation updated.
2. Feature flagged if not fully user-ready.
3. Observability hooks (logging/metrics) present.
4. Security review or checklist completed for features touching credentials or user data.

## Sprint Ceremonies & Cadence
- **Backlog Refinement**: Weekly; ensure stories have acceptance criteria and estimates.
- **Sprint Planning**: First day of sprint; align on capacity and prioritize stories.
- **Daily Standups**: 15 minutes focusing on blockers and coordination.
- **Sprint Review/Demo**: Last day; showcase completed features to stakeholders.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Immediately after review; capture improvements for next sprint.
